Description: The TimeMetric package provides a comprehensive framework for 
    evaluating prediction performance in survival analysis. It consolidates a 
    wide range of metrics, including pseudo R-squared measures, concordance 
    indices, time-dependent AUC, and Brier Score, into a unified platform. 
    TimeMetric supports right-censored data, competing risks, and complex 
    sampling designs such as nested case-control and case-cohort studies. 
    It extends and generalizes the functionality originally introduced in 
    the PAmeasure package, offering a standardized and extensible interface 
    for researchers and practitioners working with survival models.

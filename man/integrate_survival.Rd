\title{Integrate Predicted Survival Probabilities Over Time}
\usage{
integrate_survival(predicted_probability, event_time, status, tau = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{predicted_probability}{A numeric matrix or data frame of predicted survival
probabilities at observed times, with one row per subject (matching the order of \code{event_time})
and one or more columns for different prediction models or time points.}

\item{event_time}{A numeric vector of observed event or censoring times.}

\item{status}{A binary vector indicating event occurrence 
(1 = event, 0 = censored) for each subject.}

\item{tau}{Optional numeric value specifying the maximum truncation time. 
If \code{NULL} (default), the maximum observed event time is used.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of cumulative integrated predictions, with one element per
column in \code{predicted_probability}.
}
\description{
Computes an integrated survival (or risk) measure by summing predicted probabilities 
across observed follow-up times, weighted by the time increments between events.
This function is intended for internal use within the package.

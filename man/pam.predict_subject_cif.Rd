\title{Predict Subject-Specific Cumulative Incidence Function (CIF)}
\usage{
pam.predict_subject_cif(
  model1 = NULL,
  model2 = NULL,
  fg_model = NULL,
  cr_model = NULL,
  tau = NULL,
  final_data,
  event.type = 1,
  covariates
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model1}{The fitted model for the target cause (either a `coxph` or `survreg` object).}

\item{model2}{The fitted model for competing causes (either a `coxph` or `survreg` object).}

\item{fg_model}{Optional Fine-Gray model object (`crr` from `cmprsk` package).}

\item{cr_model}{Optional competing risks random forest model object.}

\item{final_data}{A data frame containing observed event times (`time`), event indicators (`status`), and covariates.}

\item{event.type}{The event type of interest for which CIF is to be predicted (required for random forest model object).}

\item{covariates}{A character vector specifying the names of the covariates used in the model.}
}
\value{
A list with two components:
\describe{
  \item{times}{umeric vector of observed times from \code{final_data$time}.}
  \item{status}{Integer vector of event indicators from \code{final_data$status}.}
  \item{cif_pred}{A matrix where the first column is time, and subsequent columns are predicted CIFs for each subject.}
  \item{pred}{Numeric vector of the integral of CIF from \code{0} to \code{tau}.}
  \item{linear.pred}{Numeric vector of subject-specific linear predictors.}
}
}
\description{
This function calculates cumulative incidence function (CIF) predictions for individual subjects 
across multiple types of competing risks models. It supports cause-specific Cox models, 
accelerated failure time (AFT) models (Weibull, Log-normal, Log-logistic), Fine-Gray models, 
and competing risks random survival forests.

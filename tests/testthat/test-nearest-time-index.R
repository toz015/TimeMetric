# Finding 42: the evaluation-time index must be chosen deterministically.

# `which.min(abs(event_time - t_star))` broke when t_star was the median of an
# even-length vector: the two middle order statistics are mathematically
# equidistant from it, so a one-ulp rounding difference decided the winner. That
# rounding differs between 80-bit-long-double platforms (x86_64 Linux, Windows)
# and plain-double ones (arm64 macOS), so the same data yielded different
# point-in-time metrics on different machines.
#
# The rule is now: nearest observed time, ties broken toward the EARLIER event
# time -- which also makes the choice independent of input row order.

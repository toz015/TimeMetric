# Characterization of Gt(), the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the censoring
# distribution.
#
# SUPERSEDED AND INTENTIONALLY UPDATED, 2026-09-25.
#
# These expectations originally pinned the pre-correction implementation, to
# prove that removing the survminer dependency was behaviour-preserving. That
# purpose is served and finished. Finding 41 then established that the pinned
# behaviour was itself wrong in three independent ways:
#
#   1. the interpolation branch indexed the raw, unsorted input vector with
#      indices into the sorted summary table, so G(t) was neither monotone nor
#      invariant to row order;
#   2. the censoring indicator was derived as status == min(status), which
#      inverted the coding entirely on data with no censoring, making G decay
#      from 1 instead of staying at 1;
#   3. a zero censoring survival was silently replaced by the smallest positive
#      value, hiding an undefined IPCW weight behind a plausible number.
#
# The values below are therefore the CORRECTED ones, from the reverse-
# Kaplan-Meier step-function estimator. They were not regenerated to make a
# failing test pass: the correction was reviewed and approved, and old and new
# values were reported side by side first.
#
# The authoritative contract now lives in test-gt-ipcw.R, which checks against
# pec::ipcw() rather than against values this package produced. This file keeps
# the boundary, tie and validation coverage.

# Deterministic fixtures shared by all characterization tests.
# Seeds are fixed; never change them without regenerating every snapshot.

# survival is deliberately NOT attached here. TimeMetric calls concordancefit()
# unqualified without importing it (findings.md #11), and a global attach would
# hide that defect from the whole suite. Tests that genuinely need it use
# withr::local_package("survival"), which scopes the attach to one test and
# detaches on exit. test-eval-survival.R reproduces the failure in a clean
# subprocess.
